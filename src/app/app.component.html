                <p class="paragraph">As my last personal project before going back to full-time work, I wanted to write
                    an interactive essay tying together my interests in farming, history, and coding. It was the perfect
                    time to follow through on an idea I have toyed with for years: a simulation of
                    the
                    growth of human societies. You can play with a sample. I will explain how this works in detail later
                    alongside more examples. </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Part I: Inspiration</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">In the 4X strategy game, <a href="https://civilization.com/"
                        target="_blank"><em>Civilization</em></a>, you command a
                    civilization (e.g. Egypt, Rome, China, etc) from the dawn of history to the space age. It is
                    fascinating watching a city emerge on a small river straddling a lonely desert, to see
                    wilderness
                    transition into farmland and pastures, to see libraries and theaters blossom, even to see the dark
                    side
                    of war and famine. Each round of the game is unique, allowing players to experience fascinating
                    alternative geographic and historical scenarios. Abraham Lincoln could lead the peace-loving Jewish
                    Mongols to explore a hitherto unknown continent.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">Playing <em>Civilization</em> was the most fun when I tuned into these nuances
                    and
                    narratives. Unfortunately, I usually got so caught up
                    in
                    winning my own game (my ego) that I stop enjoying the world around me. So what if I removed myself
                    as a player?</p>
                <p class="paragraph">There has been a lot of interest amongst
                    <em>Civ</em>
                    players in <a
                        href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/20/civilization-streams-are-making-ai-fight/"
                        target="_blank">watching the AI play itself</a>. This trend has resonated with me. Seeing how a
                    world evolves
                    organically can be as fun as playing in it. However, the game is not designed for this. It takes
                    some
                    fenagling to make it work. When I learned about zero-player games from <a
                        href="https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/" target="_blank">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, I realized
                    it was exactly what I wanted to see for <em>Civilization</em>: a game where players can set the
                    initial
                    state and
                    then sit back to watch the AI unfold history. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">The wonder of worldbuilding did not have to be coupled with excessive playtime
                    and addictiveness.
                    Instead of pouring countless
                    hours into this game, I decided to start developing my own version. However, modeling civilization
                    is a monumental
                    task. I was stuck on where to
                    begin.
                    It was my farming experience last year that made me realize every civilization shares one
                    starting point: <a href="#agriculture">agriculture</a>.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">I created this interactive essay to explain my prototype of a zero-player
                    civilization simulation. The style
                    is
                    based on Kevin Simler’s <a href="https://meltingasphalt.com/going-critical/ "
                        target="_blank"><q>Going Critical</q></a> and Nicky Case's <a href="https://ncase.me/ballot/"
                        target="_blank"><q>To Build a Better Ballot</q></a>. They create more elegant code and
                    progressions of their ideas than I
                    do here. I am grateful for their inspiration and envious of their skills. You will see more
                    instances of my app like the one above in the <a href="#simulation">simulation section</a> below.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">I
                    built the app
                    using Angular and Typescript. Veteran programmers may wince at this choice. JavaScript is prone to
                    floating point errors, and probably a poor choice for creating simulations. However, I wanted to
                    learn
                    Angular and make the essay easily accessible online. I may regret it if I continue to develop this
                    project. That is ok. The learning experience has already made it worth it.</p>

            <section id="agriculture">
                <h2 class="section-title">Part II: Agriculture</h2>
                <div class="quote-container">
                    <blockquote class="quote-container__quote"><q>Where tillage begins, other arts follow. The farmers

                <p class="paragraph"><em>Civilization V</em> uses Webster’s quote to introduce the agriculture
                    technology. Below
                    is <em>Civilization V’s</em> technology tree. It visually represents the sequences of upgrades a
                    player
                    can acquire through research. Notice agriculture is the prerequisite technology to begin researching
                    all others. This is not some arbitrary game mechanic. It is based on leading anthropological
                    theories for how civilization emerged. Simulating human civilization is a monumental task, so I
                    narrowed my goal for the first iteration of this project to <q>The Root of Civilization</q>:
                    agriculture.

                <p class="paragraph">There! I had a neat starting point. Except, like so often, the answer led to more
                    questions. How does <a href="https://www.bighistoryproject.com/chapters/4#agriculture"
                        target="_blank">agriculture lead to complex human societies</a> exactly? Before I could start
                    designing my simulation, I needed to know what this process looked like.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Put simply, agriculture creates more food. Early agrarian villages were able to
                    grow enough food to sustain larger populations than
                    their foraging contemporaries. Over millennia, innovations like the plow increased the efficiency of
                    farming. Food surpluses freed labor for specialized activities like trade, craftsmanship, art,
                    religion, and governance. Eventually towns emerged providing services like markets, granaries,
                    and temples to nearby villages. Towns led to cities and the dawn of the first
                    civilizations. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">I decided to make the
                    paleolithic phase of human history, the time before the advent of these sedentary settlements, the
                    starting point of my
                    simulation. Yet modern humans have been around for approximately 200,000 years, and agrarian
                    societies did not emerge until about 12,000 years ago. Why the gap? <em>Civilization</em> skips this
                    period by
                    providing players
                    with agriculture to begin with and allowing them to build cities right away. So what made those
                    first humans quit their ancestral lifestyle of
                    nomadic foraging and settle down to till the land?</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Most of human history took place during the Pleistocene (an Ice Age), where bands
                    of foraging humans struggled to survive in harsh environments. About 12,000 years ago, the earth
                    began to get warmer and wetter. Certain regions, particularly in the Fertile Crescent, began to
                    provide
                    abundant resources for groups of foraging humans. The people that lived in these proverbial Gardens
                    of Eden became relatively wealthy. These affluent foragers had enough food that they no longer
                    needed to migrate regularly. They became sedentary. Without the constraints of a nomadic lifestyle,
                    their populations began to swell from dozens to hundreds. Frequent migration into these rich regions
                    added to their numbers. They slowly fell into the trap of sedentism: overpopulation. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">Eventually there were so many people that even the rich land could not sustain all
                    the inhabitants. The region became so crowded there was no open land to migrate to. The affluent
                    foragers were stuck. They had no choice but to look for a way to increase the productivity of the
                    land they were standing on. Thousands of years of ancestral knowledge and necessity led to the first
                    domestication of crops. Domestication is analogous to a symbiotic
                    relationship we create with plants and animals. Humanity realized we could reap large, regular
                    harvests of the plants we like if we cultivate them. Agriculture began. Densely populated
                    settlements soon followed. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">Now we that we have figured out the why and the when, there is one more line of
                    questioning to tackle:
                    where did agriculture emerge? Why did it emerge independently in some places and not others?</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Agriculture is about domesticating plant and animal species and certain species are
                    more
                    amenable to domestication than others. The Fertile Crescent was the cradle of civilization because
                    it had the most suitable crops and animals for domestication e.g. emmer wheat, einkorn, cows, goats,
                    sheep, etc. Some other crops that catalyzed the development of complex societies include rice (in
                    China), maize (in Mesoamerica), and potatoes (in the Andes). Other crops allowed for limited growth
                    of complex societies like Taro in New Guinea. Yet nowhere was as well endowed as the Middle East.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">Potential domesticates explains why certain biospheres were better grounds for
                    agriculture, but it does not explain why the first cities emerges in Mesopotamia and not nearby
                    Anatolia. The final key is life's most basic necessity: water. Specifically fresh water. To this
                    day, procuring enough potable water is a preerquisite to all human endeavors. Every early city
                    emerged alongside a convenient fresh water source: the Sumerian cities along the Tigris and
                    Euphrates, the Egyptians along the Nile, the Chinese along the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, and so on.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">This research into the origin of agriculture provided me a clear process
                    for simulating civilization. First, nomadic foragers settle the earth. Second, overpopulation forces
                    them to find new means of procuring food. Third, climates suitable for agriculture will yield better
                    results for early farmers. Finally, locations with good climates and convenient fresh water will
                    evolve into agrarian villages and eventually the cities that represent the first phase of
                    civilization.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Part III: The Simulation</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">Now that we have a basic understanding for the theory of why agriculture emerged,
                    it is time to look at the simulation. But before I dive into the technical details of how it works,
                    let’s look at a sample.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Below is a map of the Fertile Crescent during the Ice Age. Use the control
                    panel to iterate forward in the simulation, pause, or reset. Don’t worry if you don’t understand
                    what
                    is going on yet.</p>

                </app-mini-map>
                <div class="map-separator">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="paragraph">In the example above, we start with a lone Band of 10 foragers roaming the land.
                    Over the centuries, they spawn dozens of more Bands until the entire map is crowded. Yet this is
                    still the ice age. Populations remain small. The cold climate prevents agriculture from taking hold.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">This key should help clarify what is happening as I explain the mechanics of what

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Polities Key</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">All Polities start out as Bands. As they develop into Villages and later Towns,
                    they grow faster and have increased farming abilities. In the future, I want to add additional
                    abilities with each evolution of the Polity, such as markets and government centers.</p>

                        href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3235/object-oriented-programming-oop"
                        target="_blank">object-oriented model</a>, the simulation centers on the interaction
                    between two objects: Polities (groups of humans) and Regions (units of land represented by tiles).
                    All objects are capitalized in this essay.
                    Each iteration of their interactions represents a year. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">Each Region is positioned on a 12x12 grid. There are 144 Regions in each map. Based
                    on its climate, each Region replenishes a fixed amount of food each turn. However, each climate has
                    a fixed maximum amount of food that accumulates naturally. Climates can be either temperate,
                    tropical, dry, continental, polar, or ocean. Some Regions have rivers that increase food yield from
                    farming.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">There can be zero or one Polities per Region. Every Polity has two or more people.
                    Each person requires one food each year.
                    Polities extract food from corresponding Regions each year and consume it. They can increase this
                    yield by farming. Population grows based on
                    the Polity's growth rate which starts at 1%, meaning each person in the Polity has a 1% chance of
                    adding another person. Note this does not guarantee population will grow each year. Fractional
                    population is not possible.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Let’s take a break from the word wall and look at an example.</p>
                <app-mini-map class='map' [title]='"Single Continental Region"'
                    [regions]='singleTileContinentalMap._regions' [rivers]='singleTileContinentalMap._rivers'>
                </app-mini-map>
                <div class="map-separator">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="paragraph">Above is a simplified model of a single Polity and a single Region. The Region has
                    a continental climate, so it generates 10 food each turn and can hold a maximum of 50 food. Once the
                    population grows beyond 10, it will begin to expend the Region’s excess food. Its population will
                    then be limited to 10 plus a few more from extra food grown through farming. With so little space
                    and a cold climate, the
                    population won’t exceed much more than 15.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Nomadic Bands</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Every Polity has a subclass: Band, Village, or Town. Simulations begin with a
                    single Band. Each year, Bands will search for the neighboring tile with the highest food yield.
                    Movement can be made horizontally,
                    vertically, or diagonally to one of the eight neighboring tiles so long as it exists and is not an
                    ocean. If there is a tie for highest yield, the Band moves randomly. It will opt to stay in its
                    current tile to farm if no neighbors have more food.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">A Band's populations grows at a rate of 1% per year. When its population can no
                    longer sustain
                    itself on any of the available tiles, a Band divides into two Bands. The new Band will move to the
                    Region with the second highest yield, while the original Band gets the best yielding Region. The new
                    Band’s population will be between the number the parent
                    could not feed and half the parent’s population.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Let’s see what happens if we give the Band room to migrate.</p>
                <app-mini-map class='map' [title]='"Five Continental Regions"'
                    [regions]='fiveTileContinentalMap._regions' [rivers]='fiveTileContinentalMap._rivers'>
                </app-mini-map>
                <div class="map-separator">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="paragraph">With five continental Regions, the food yield is 50 each year. However, a Band can
                    only occupy a single Region at a time. Each year, the initial Band will forage one Region and
                    migrate
                    to an unused one with more food available. The extra space allows the Band to grow more but once its
                    population exceeds 50 (the maximum natural food storage for continental Regions), it will divide
                    itself into two Bands. In this manner, the entire island will be occupied after a couple centuries,
                    and each Band will be confined to a single tile like in the previous example.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">The Trap of Sedentism Leads to Farming</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">All maps gradually fill up with Bands of foragers like this. When a
                    Band has nowhere left to move for additional food, it will begin farming to augment its food supply.
                    This mechanic mimics the trap of sedentism discussed above. Farming allows Polities to increase a
                    Region’s yearly food yield beyond its natural maximum
                    capacity. Farming yield is determined by the formula:</p>
                <p class="paragraph">(R * (FL + RC) * FY * P) / 100</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Where,</p>
                <p class="paragraph">R = random number (between 0 and 1)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">FL = farming level (between 1 and 20)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">RC = river connections (between 0 and 4)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">FY = food yielded naturally from the region (based on climate)</p>
                <p class="paragraph">P = population of the polity</p>
                <p class="paragraph">With farming, Polities dramatically increase the amount of food they can produce,
                    allowing their populations to grow beyond the natural limits of their Region. Their farming level
                    increases the more they farm successfully. However, if they fail to produce enough food to feed
                    their population, the excess people will starve. This risk is
                    mitigated by food storage capacity. As farming levels increase, so does the amount of excess food
                    Polities can carry over from year to year. With high yields from good years stored to avoid famines
                    in bad years, Band populations will grow into the hundreds.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Climate as Destiny</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Here is where the importance of climate comes in. The continental Regions we have
                    seen up until
                    now
                    don’t allow for Bands to reach high farming levels. That changes in warmer, wetter Regions like the
                    temperate one below.</p>
                <app-mini-map class='map' [title]='"Five Temperate Regions"' [regions]='fiveTileTemperateMap._regions'
                    [rivers]='fiveTileTemperateMap._rivers'></app-mini-map>
                <div class="map-separator">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="paragraph">You see the same dynamic as having continental Regions except
                    populations grow higher due to natural abundance. Temperate Regions generate 20 food per turn and
                    have a natural maximum food of 100.
                    The Polity won’t use up this natural excess until it has more than 20 people. By then, its farming
                    level
                    will have risen, allowing it to sustain a much larger population than the Region could naturally
                    hold. However, the population won’t reach much higher than 200 before starvation ensues.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Variations in climate are thus critical. Let’s shake it up and see what an island
                    with five different climates looks like: polar, continental, temperate, dry, and tropical.</p>
                <app-mini-map class='map' [title]='"Five Climates"' [regions]='allClimatesMap._regions'
                    [rivers]='allClimatesMap._rivers'></app-mini-map>
                <div class="map-separator">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="paragraph">You can see how the Bands favor temperate tiles. Only when their temperate
                    neighbors are depleted will Bands venture into the continental. When they have no other choice, they
                    will move into the dry and polar climates. However, Bands in the dry will be able to discover the
                    more favorable tropical climate, which yields more than continental but still less than the
                    temperate. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">Even with all this room and variation, Bands still stagnate in a single tile. The
                    overall population won’t exceed much more than 1,100 before mass starvation. </p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">The Gift of the River</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">In order to catalyze the emergence of civilizations, we need to introduce another
                    dynamic: fresh water. Regions receive a farming bonus for each corner they have that includes
                    a river. Watch what happens to the Bands along the new river, especially in temperate climates. Use
                    the
                    plus button to jump ahead 1,000 years or so if you have to. </p>
                <app-mini-map class='map' [title]='"Five Climates & a river"' [regions]='allClimatesRiverMap._regions'
                    [rivers]='allClimatesRiverMap._rivers'></app-mini-map>
                <div class="map-separator">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="paragraph">Eventually, you will see some of the Bands straddling rivers transition into
                    Villages. The total population should not exceed much more than 11,000.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">From Villages to Towns to Cities</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Bands that have 500 or more people and are connected to a river evolve into
                    Villages. A Village represents the next stage in the evolution of civilization. It can reach higher
                    farming levels, has a growth rate of 2%, but is incapable of migrating to neighboring tiles when
                    food is scarce like Bands. There is still one more step that the map
                    above is too small to reach. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">When a Village reaches a population of 5,000 or more and has at least three
                    neighbors that are also Villages, it will evolve into a Town. Towns represent the last stage in a
                    Polity’s development before becoming a City. The emergence of Towns indicates that a Civilization is
                    emerging in that
                    area. <q>The Root of Civilization</q> has thus sprouted into a shrub. Since this essay is not titled
                    <q>The Shrub of Civilization</q>, I will save future developments for another version. For now,
                    Towns have no change in functionality from Village besides their visual
                    representation on the map.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Historical Scenarios</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">To see how Villages evolve into Towns, we will go back to historical examples. We
                    will see how this simulation can help us understand how climate changes contributed to the emergence
                    of Sumerian Civilization in the Fertile Crescent.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Earlier we saw what the Fertile Crescent looked like during the last Ice Age, over
                    15,000 years ago. Not much was going on. With the end of the Ice Age, earth became warmer and
                    wetter. The Fertile Crescent transitioned into an ideal area for civilization to develop. So let’s
                    take a look at what happens in a warmer version of the previous map.</p>
                <app-mini-map class='map' [title]='"Fertile Crescent"' [regions]='fertileCrescentMap._regions'
                    [rivers]='fertileCrescentMap._rivers'></app-mini-map>
                <div class="map-separator">&nbsp;</div>
                <p class="paragraph">We see familiar dynamics. Bands favor temperate climates and multiply until there
                    is no more room. Those Bands trapped into sedentary lifestyles in temperate climates along rivers
                    will develop into Villages. However, a new dynamic emerges. Many villages evolve alongside each
                    other, allowing for larger Villages to evolve into Towns, the precursors to cities. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">The Fertile Crescent was not the only place climate change made suitable for
                    agriculture. Civilizations emerge independently in multiple areas around the globe. I made a couple
                    more historical models to represent the other two areas that we know independently invented writing.

                <p class="paragraph">Above we can see the growth of Chinese civilization along the Yellow and Yangtze
                    rivers. The earliest evidence of rice cultivation in China dates to about 8,000 years ago. Cities
                    developed around 4,000 years ago.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">This final example takes us across the Pacific. Its geographic isolation proves
                    agriculture was discovered independently by disparate peoples.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The map here is less elaborate as I am least familiar with Mesoamerican history. The river in the middle is meant to represent ancient Lake
                    Texcoco, where modern Mexico City now stands. Agriculture was developed here around 4,500 years ago and cities shortly after.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">I wrote this essay to outline my vision of a fun and educational simulation for the
                    unfolding of human history. The major aspects of
                    this version are migration, population growth, the trap of sedentism, the influence of climate, and fresh water.
                    Each of these was critical for civilization as we know it to emerge. Of course, there is a lot more
                    to the story than that. In the next section I will explore how I can expand this project in the
                    future.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Part IV: Going Forward</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">I could write an essay twice this size about what I am leaving out of this
                    simulation. When I was designing it a few weeks ago, I had a storm of ideas I have since pared down
                    to population growth and a simple farming equation. Before I wrap up, I’d like to review of these.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Realistic Populations</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Ideally, I would like the simulation to have realistic population estimates. If
                    this were the case, each of the historical models I have created above should reach populations into
                    the millions. There is no precise data for this, but I would like to create a world
                    map with a size that makes population growth commensurate with <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#Past_population" target="_blank">these
                        projections</a>. </p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Simulation Testing</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Coming up with clear, reviewable statistics is also on the idea list. I could
                    create an environment divorced from the UI that simply runs the math and outputs results in a CSV
                    file. I could then run hundreds of simulations to test and refine settings until they most closely
                    resemble the real-world data mentioned above. Yet a part of me dreads revisiting computer simulation
                    concepts. My simulations course in college was a mess of Monte Carlo methods in C and the hardest
                    class I ever took. However, applying those principles would take this program to the next level. </p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Polity Hierarchy</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">I would also like to play with the design of the Polity object. In <a
                        href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/" target="_blank"><em>Sapiens</em></a>, Harari
                    mentions a system for classifying human societies in stages: Band &rarr; Tribe &rarr; Chiefdom
                    &rarr; State. This scheme of sociopolitical development is borrowed from <a
                        href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elman-Rogers-Service" target="_blank">Elman
                        Service</a>. It struck
                    me as a good system for modeling the development of societies through gradually more advanced object
                    classes. I could add three subclasses to Polity: Tribe, Chiefdom, and State. However, I might have
                    to rethink the current model entirely if I go this route. </p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Polity Behavior and Personalities</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">As of now, all of the Polities actions are based around acquiring food. While
                    sustenance is naturally the priority, people can do a lot more than forage and farm. I want to give
                    Bands different personality traits that compel them to make different choices. I want to introduce
                    combat and religion as alternatives to farming. Instead of relying on farming, aggressive bands
                    could pillage their neighbors. There is also a theory for <a
                        href="https://www.bighistoryproject.com/chapters/4#creating-settlements"
                        target="_blank">religion spurring the development of
                        agriculture</a>, but it unclear to me how I will model this. These changes should add a lot more
                    variability and excitement to the simulation.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Plant and Animal Objects</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Originally, I wanted to model how the domestication of plant and animal species
                    like emmer wheat and cattle were critical for the development of civilizations. For example, wheat
                    was more adaptable to agriculture than corn, one of the reasons maize growing Mesoamerica took
                    longer to develop than wheat growing Mesopotamia. However, as I realized how big a project this was,
                    I scaled back my goals for this first iteration. Next time, I would like to introduce domesticate
                    crops like wheat, maize, rice, potatoes, and taro. I will also consider domesticate animals like
                    dogs, cattle, goats, and pigs. In line with the <a
                        href="https://cromblog.com/writing-portfolio/book-reviews/botany-of-desire/"
                        target="_blank">coevolutionary theory of domestication</a>, I
                    would like to make these their own objects and not completely subordinate to Polities. </p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">App Design</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">In this essay, I condensed the original version of the app into a compact mini map
                    that I could include multiple times for demonstrative purposes. The full version is richer in detail. In my next iteration, I would like to refine it into a standalone web app with an
                    options menu and more features. A map-maker mode would be key to making this into a true
                    zero-player game. </p>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">I am dreaming up a lot more work for myself. Honestly, I do not know exactly where
                    I am going with this project. I just know I want it to continue. It is not going to be my main focus like it
                    has been these past few weeks. It is time to get a job before the recession hits. I’ll keep working
                    on this occasionally. At the very least, it will help me refine my coding skills. Yet I have this
                    feeling it will lead to something bigger. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">I’ll end with a note on names. I am particularly fond of “The Root of Civilization”
                    as an essay title. It got me thinking. How about I name each iteration of this project based on the
                    growth a tree. The next one could be a “shrub”, representing the growing stage of the first towns
                    and
                    cities. Then the next stage could be a <q>tree</q>, simulating fully developed agrarian civilizations.
                    After that? I am thinking something like <q>The Factory of Civilization</q>, where the tree is being
                    chopped down and used to develop commodities. This would represent the industrial era. After that? I
                    am not so prescient. Appealing names probably should not define my course of development ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
